### Hi there 👋 I'm an orange🍊

## I am pursuing Computer💻 Science to hopefully become a professor👨‍🏫 to teach the subject. 
I have over 15 years of professional experience in subjects like English🏁, eating🍽, procrastination⏳, sleeping😴, and more! I have 0 professional computer science experience, I just do this all myself on my own ( and begging others for help)
Currently working on a website🕸, so that is soon to come. 

# Fun Fact
I can solve a Rubik's cube! So fun!
