### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am pursuing Computer Science to hopefully become a professor to teach the subject. 
I have over 15 years of professional experience in subjects like English, eating, procrastination, sleeping, and more! I have 0 professional computer science experience, I just do this all myself on my own ( and begging others for help)
Currently working on a website, so that is soon to come. 

# Fun Fact
I can solve a Rubik's cube! So fun!
